  TI46 isolated-word corpus
    The 46-word vocabulary consists of two sub-vocabularies: 
    (1) the TI 20-word vocabulary (consisting of the digits zero through nine 
        plus the words "enter," "erase," "go," "help," "no," "rubout," "repeat," "stop," "start," and "yes" as well as 
    (2) the TI 26-word "alphabet set" (consisting of the letters "a" through "z").
